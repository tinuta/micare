            <h1>How to recognise a good restaurant?</h1>
            <p>A good restaurant sets a high standard for its food quality and ensures that guests receive the same quality with every meal. Serving quality food can earn your restaurant a good reputation and compel your guests to return for repeat visits. High-quality ingredients and an experienced cook are important to serving good food consistently. A good cook understands your guests' needs and works well with the kitchen staff to ensure that guests receive their meal the way they ordered it every time. One of the key characteristics of a successful restaurant is a positive customer experience, explains The Restaurant Times. The staff who interact with your guests should be courteous and maintain a positive attitude. Servers should know the menu well, deliver guestsâ€™ food and drinks on time, and quickly address any issues that an unsatisfied guest may have.

                All staff should help to keep the restaurant clean at all times, including the kitchen, food preparation areas and any areas that guests come into contact with. Make sure you check your online reviews on a regular basis to learn what customers think of the experience they received at your restaurant.</p>

                <h1>What is a Restaurant Cook?</h1>
                <p>A restaurant cook is someone whose responsibility it is to prepare and cook various appetizers,
                    entrees and desserts; to ensure the ingredients used are fresh; to make sure the work area is clean;
                    and to have any necessary equipment readily available. Restaurant cooks follow recipes, mix
                    ingredients, and prepare many types of foods, using various cooking methods, such as braising,
                    steaming, baking and broiling.

                    The term 'cook' within a restaurant kitchen may also refer to a person with little to no creative
                    influence on a menu and little to no command over others within the kitchen, such as a line cook.
                    These are usually all workers of a restaurant kitchen that are underneath the sous chef in the
                    brigade de cuisine.</p>
